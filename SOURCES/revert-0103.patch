CA-184578: Fix multipath booting on CentOS 7.1+

When multipathd first starts, it gets the wwid of each device
and compares it with the blacklist exception and removes each
existing multipath device (which has been set up in the initrd)
which does not meet the criteria. For some reason, at boot,
the device does not return it's wwid (either through udev or page 0x83)
and so multipathd removes it which causes the boot to fail.
To work around this, revert this patch which somehow prevents multipathd
from later recreating the multipath device.
